# Crowdfunding_ETL

By Frewoini Mebrahtu and Eric Johnson

Used Python/Pandas to import crowdfunding data from excel and perform ETL, extracting the data, transforming it, and loading it into PostgreSQL. Choose option 1 to utilize Pandas to create the contacts DataFrame. We did not see any instructions on analyzing the data for this project. 

Utilized in class activities mostly, but also ChatGTP for debugging.
